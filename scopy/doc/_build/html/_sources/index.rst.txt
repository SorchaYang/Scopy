The Scopy Documentation!
========================
The python package Scopy is designed by `CBDD Group`_ (Computational Biology & Drug Design Group), Xiangya School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Central South University. To decrease noise, generated by some molecule with some unexpected attribution, in the activity of virtual screening, a pre-filter is necessary. Such a filter could compute some specific physicochemical properties or(and) compare with known substructures related with unwanted properties. Scopy(Screening COmpounds in PYthon) is a such filter that can involve prediction of physicochemical properties, search for toxicophores or other unwanted chemical groups. There are 41 physicochemical properties and 15 drug-likeness rules could be computed or checked. Scopy also could screen compounds under 21 endpoints which totally contain 2,167 unexpected groups in SMARTS format. In addtion, 7 fingerprints, retrieved from fragments, supplied in Scopy. We hope that the package can be used for filtering some bad molecules in advance and be a role in your drug discovery progress.
